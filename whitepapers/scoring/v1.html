<h1>CoinHonesty Scoring White-paper:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>A memecoin should be funny, if it is, it gets 3 points</li>
    <li>Newer memecoins should also have a usage, this adds 4 points</li>
    <li>The coin should have a 24 hour volume of at least 1 million, this adds 13 points to its CH score</li>
    <li>Unless a coin was just released, it should have 10 thousand or more total transactions, this adds 10 points to its total score</li>
    <li>Liquidity is very important, a coin must have at least 15 thousand dollars in liquidity to get 15 points, any lower and 1K in liquidity is 1 point</li>
    <li>If a whale is too big, it can cause significant price changes, it also increases the chance that the coin in a rug, any more than a 15% whale and it does not get its next 10 points</li>
    <li>There must be at least 1000 holders in a coin or it might be a rug, if it completes this criteria it gets 5 more points</li>
    <li>De.Fi searches of vulnerabilities in a coin’s source code, as well as well as checking if it is a honeypot, 10 points in De.Fi equal 1 point in its CoinHonesty score</li>
    <li>Not being easy to remember the coin is a big negative signal, so it’s remembrance is scored out of 3 (1=5, 2=10, 3=15)</li>
    <li>If it isn’t easy to buy on DEXs or CEXs, it does not get its next 5 points</li>
    <li>The average holders derivative (average new holders per day) is a big metric, 0-10 is not a good sign at all, 10-30 is not the best but okay, 30-50 is okay, 50-100 is great, and 100+ is amazing, each level gives a new point</li>
    <li>Having an x account is key, and gives 1 point, if it posts 1 or more times per week, that’s a bonus of 2 points</li>
    <li>Lastly, not all coins are on coinmarketcap, but many are on coingecko, being on coinmarketcap (not self-reported) gives our coin its last 2 points</li>
